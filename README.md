## Project Title

GBDA302 Week 4 Example 5: Blob Platformer (JSON + Classes)

---

## Authors

Karen Cochrane and David Han (starter code)
I added modifications and extensions to meet Week 4 criteria

## Description

This project matches the structure of the original blob sketch from Week 2 but moves details into classes. The provided example was updated to generate levels using JSON data and loops instead of hardcoding platform layouts.

Levels are defined in levels.json using a tilemap array, and the game uses nested loops to dynamically place platforms (tiles), coins, and the exit door at runtime. A second level is included and loads automatically once the first level is completed.

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- - load JSON in preload( )
- - generate levels using JSON data (tilemap array)
- - use loops to dynamically place platforms, coins, and the exit door
- - create WorldLevel from JSON
- - create BlobPlayer
- - update + draw each frame
- - handle input events (jump, optional next level)
- - automatically load the next level when the current level is finished
